# arXiv-R
### an unofficial android app

#### but y tho?
The existing arXiv app doesn't have the functions I want, so I'm making this.

It's far from done, I assure you.

Also, this is my first project in Java, so code tips and suggestions are very welcome.

#### Currently working on:
- Favorites
- Auto-update
- Settings
- Make articles accessible

#### Remaining tasks:
- Finish designing custom search dialog
- Add sub-section filtering
- "More articles" card
- Make the actual widget, yo. You know, the whole reason you started this timesink in the first place.
- Expand to all categories

#### Additional features:
If I have time...
- history

#### Done
- Recyclerview
- Card expansion
- Local storage
- Check last update
- Sharing
